                        We keep providing platforms for the kids to perform at various prestigious events as well as exclusively organized showcase concerts by Dance Out Of Poverty. The concerts are designed as a platform for the students to perform in front of an audience. Since it is the first time most students are performing on stage in front of their friends and family, it instills a sense of confidence in them and strengthens this belief that anything is possible in life.</p>
                    <p data-aos="zoom-in" className="mb-4">
                        Being a community event, the concert encourages to bring together as many people from the community- parents, friends, peers and school/NGO staff to attend, creating a safe, inclusive space for the students to perform. The Dance Out Of Poverty Team works extremely hard to deliver a professional, high quality concert experience for the students. </p>
